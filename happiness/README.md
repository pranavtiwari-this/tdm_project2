- **Negative Affect**: The average is **0.27** and shows a notable negative correlation (**-0.35**) with Life Ladder, indicating that lower experiences of negative emotions are linked to higher life satisfaction.

### 5. Missing Values Analysis
- There are several variables with missing data: 
  - **Log GDP per capita** (28 missing)
  - **Social support** (13 missing)
  - **Healthy life expectancy at birth** (63 missing)
  - **Freedom to make life choices** (36 missing)
  - **Generosity** (81 missing)
  - **Perceptions of corruption** (125 missing)
  - **Positive affect** (24 missing)

  - Significant positive correlations exist between **Life Ladder** and **Log GDP per capita (0.78)**, **Social Support (0.72)**, and **Healthy Life Expectancy (0.71)**.
  - Negative relationships are observed between **Life Ladder** and **Perceptions of Corruption (-0.43)**.
  
### 7. Conclusion
This dataset reveals essential insights into how various indicators, including economic, social, and health factors, relate to subjective well-being across countries. The significant correlations underscore the importance of economic stability, social support, and health in enhancing life satisfaction. However, the analysis is tempered by the presence of missing values and the inherent complexity of measuring happiness and well-being across diverse cultural contexts. Further detailed statistical modeling could provide richer insights and address the gaps in the data.
